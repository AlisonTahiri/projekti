This will be a full stack project which will include a static website for general information of a town, custom CMS for blog authors and a dedicated blog section.
Maybe later I will also add a custom BE with properties, cars etc which will have a nodejs BE with custom filters.

For the blog I will add categories and tags to filter articles and also a custom static search with pagefind.
Will add intl for articles in different languages.
I will also add rss capability and average article read time.

For the tech stack, I am planning to use Nextjs + shadcn + prisma + Mongodb + Cloudinary + NextAuth

TODOS:
1 - [ ] add nextauth
2 - [ ] create cms
